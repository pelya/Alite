    	<p>The intergalactic hyperdrive is expensive and can be obtained
    	only from planets at Tech level 10 or higher. It can only be used
    	once, and will take you to a system in a whole new galaxy (i.e. a
    	new galactic chart). There are 8 such galaxies and making 8 jumps
    	will return you to your starting galaxy. The intergalactic
    	hyperdrive is engaged by pressing the button shown above, which
    	can be found on the second button page on the right hand side.</p>
