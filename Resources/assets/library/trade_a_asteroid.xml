        <p>There is money in rock, but to make the most of it a Cobra
        ship must be fitted with a fuel scoop and a MinReduc 15 Mining
        Laser (or some equivalent type). The mining laser will blast very
        large asteroids into very small fragments and the scoop can rapidly
        swallow this tradeable ore.</p>

	Asteroids are large chunks of rock which are mines (for the valuable
	trace elements that they contain) with the aid of a mining laser
	designed to fragment the rock into splinters small enough to be
	taken into a cargo bay by a fuel scoop. As they are a navigational
	hazard, a small bounty is paid for destroying an asteroid.
