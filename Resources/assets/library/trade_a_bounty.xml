        <p>Galactic banks, which insure the larger trading convoys, will pay
        a large bounty for each pirate ship destroyed. A ship&apos;s
        computer will transmit photographic evidence of any kill to the
        GalCop Bank Federation Monitoring Authority. The IR signature of the
        destroyed ship is then tallied with all known pirate vessels, and
        the bounty hunter pilot credited accordingly.</p>
        <p>Bounty hunters commonly have Cobra Class ships in order to
        masquerade as traders. They simply hyperspace into a system
        (anarchic and feudal worlds especially) and wait to be attacked,
        ensuring that they have sufficient hyperspace fuel (Quirium) for
        a quick escaoe.</p>
