	<p>Small, reliable one-man fighter, common until the standardised
	version of the Mamba became available on the open market. But after
	a short Mamba boom, many pilots later on preferred the Krait to its
	successor, because of the weak shielding of the Mamba, so the Krait
	can still be found everywhere.</p>
