	<p>Though most of the Thargoid Space Fleet is currently engaged by
	the Galactic Navy in Intergalactic Space, a few of the smaller
	battle ships make occasional sorties into Human Space. These ships
	are extremely fast for their size and invariably have ECM Systems
	(this was originally a Thargoid invention to counter Navy missiles,
	subsequently copied by the Navy from captured Thargoid ships).</p>
	<p>Additionally, most Thargoid battle ships carry a few small
	remote-controlled ships, each equipped with a single pulse laser. It
	is rumoured that the Galactic Navy are designing their own
	remote-controlled fighter and will pay well for Thargoid ones to
	study.</p>
