    	<p>This is available from all Tech level 9 planets; docking
    	computers are fitted to the ship&apos;s flight control system and
    	enable it to dock the ship automatically. The auto-docking sequence
    	is triggered by the button shown above and switched off by pressing
    	the button again.</p>
    	<p>Note that the docking computer can be configured to operate in
    	&apos;fast&apos;-mode, where it places the pilot into a brief
    	sleep. However, if the pilot&apos;s legal status is not CLEAN,
    	sleep will not be triggered, because Vipers might attack
    	the pilot&apos;s ship and leave it undefended. Instead, the
    	docking computer will then operate in its default
    	&apos;slow&apos;-mode.</p>
    	<p>[b]Docking computer specification:[/b] The SinCorn RemLock D&amp;A
    	System is a sophisticated and expensive piece of gadgetry. It comes
    	with MemnSomn pilot interaction to induce hi-cram sleep during the
    	maoeuvre.</p>
