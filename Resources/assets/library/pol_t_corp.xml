        <p>Like [b]ENGEMA[/b] and [b]ZAATXE[/b], these are well-ordered
        worlds, which have usually developed from settlers who practised a
        free trade form of competition. Taxation is high on such worlds, but
        the living standards are high also. Corporate planets wish to
        [i]protect[/i] their trade, so goods are expensive, but luxuries are
        welcomed. Import licences are often necessary.</p>
        <p>Engema is an agricultural world, run as a single farming
        co-operative. Farmers receive a fixed payment for their crops,
        whether or not the harvest is good, and selling prices do not vary
        greatly. It is a dependable market, and customer relations are good.
        Luxuries, machinery and raw materials sell well here.</p>
        <p>Zaatxe is an example of a rich, industrial state (Tech level 12).
        It produces luxury goods, elaborate and innovative machine systems,
        and specialises in Prototype design. Prices fluctuate depending upon
        the level of inter-state competition, but it is always a safe bet to
        buy recently-developed machine items which have not yet spread very
        far across the galaxy.</p>
