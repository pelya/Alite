        <p>In most trading and combat operations, certain ships are
        repeatedly encountered. All ships, whether unarmed cargo shuttles or
        Navy transporters, are potentially dangerous as pirate and bounty
        hunting activity spreads. Some ships are potentially more dangerous
        than others.</p>
        <p>The brief guide given here is just an indication of the range
        of ship-types plying the trade and space lanes. The illustrations
        show top, side and front views of each craft. Dimension data provide
        the scale. For a fuller account see [i]Klaudia&apos;s Galactic
        Ships and Remote Colonial Construction,[/i] 5th Edition, 3205 pub.
