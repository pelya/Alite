	<p>Patented by Robert Bream, but not manufactured until Ace and
	Faber improved upon the original design specifications after the
	death of the inventor. Later the design was stolen and widely
	circulated to a number of &apos;backyard&apos; workshops who
	produced the ship in vast numbers with many individual variances to
	protect companies against lawsuits. Mainly used as a single-pilot
	combat craft, typically pirates.</p>
