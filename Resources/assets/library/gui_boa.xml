	<p>Although marginally smaller than the Python, which it superseded,
	the Boa has a greater cargo capacity due to refinements in equipment
	design (e.g. the Renold Astrogation bloc is one fifth the size of
	the previous Machanalian Interspatial Wayfinder) and reduced number
	of necessary crew. Largely developed out of the recommendations left
	by Commodore Monty, a Python Captain of 45 years experience.</p>
