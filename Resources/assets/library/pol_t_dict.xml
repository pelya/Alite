        <p>Dictatorships such as the worlds [b]LAVE[/b] and [b]ENZAER[/b],
        are only moderately safe to trade with, but are well worth the risk
        (provided the trader is well defended and combat trained). Very
        often pirate attack will [i]not[/i] occur because of an agreement
        between pirate fleets and the world itself. A proportion of all
        incoming trade is &apos;allowed&apos; to be stolen by pirates, who
        will then leave the world alone, and protect its ships from aliens
        or rogue traders. It is an uneasy liaison, which often breaks
        down.</p>
        <p>Lave is an agricultural world, and Enzaer an industrial planet,
        but a similar principle operates on both surfaces. There are two
        trading standards, that of the People and that of the Aristocracy.
        Standards of living are artifically generated, a veneer of progress,
        and luxury goods, machinery and textiles sell well -- usually. The
        great demand, however, is for basic commodities, especially
        foodstuffs, clothing and raw materials. These will sell well when
        the voice of the People has been raised in protest.</p>
