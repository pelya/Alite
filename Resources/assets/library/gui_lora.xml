	<p>The Lancehead was originally designed by Skunkworx as the ultimate royal escort craft.
	It can be outfitted with some serious firepower and has great manouevrability. However, the
	Lancehead has very little cargo space. Due to its wing shaped hull it can transition from
	space to atmospheric flight with ease and is at home in either environment. This ability has
	made the craft the first choice for rich kids that want to have fun buzzing planets that have
	not yet developed enough to become space faring.</p>
