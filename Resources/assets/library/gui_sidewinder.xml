	<p>Designed by Faulcon de Lacy and built in the Onrira Orbital
	Shipyards by Spalder and Starblaze Inc to Galactic Navy
	specifications for a multi-purpose support craft. Mainly used for
	atmosphere and planetary surface scouting, but extensively too for
	city-strafing, reconnaisance and infantry air support (and by
	pirates who favour speed and elusiveness, its primary advantage).
	Has some interspatial capability, not including hyperspace, and
	must be carried through hyperspace by jump-capable vessels. Hull is
	too small for the installation of fuel scoops, or more than one
	missile pod.</p>
