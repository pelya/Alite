        <p>The [p]Buy Screen[/p] activates a list of basic trade items at
        current market prices.</p>
        <p>Shown on this list are the quantities of each item available,
        and the current market price per unit. Most CorCom Trade Systems
        deal exclusively under blanket categories, including
        [i]FOOD, MACHINERY, MINERALS,[/i] and [i]GEMSTONES.[/i]</p>
        <p>The prices shown at the time of trading represent an offer to you
        and will be guaranteed while you are in Trading Mode.</p>
        <p>The purchasing of items is almost instantaneous: If you wish to
        buy, numerically indicate the amount you wish to purchase; autoSCAM
        modules will immediately load your purchase into the cargo bay. Your
        screen will indicate your remaining credit facility.</p>
	<p>The Cobra trade ship must dock with a Coriolis space station
	before buying or selling cargo. It has no Free Space trade facility,
	apart from routine jettisoning of cannisters.</p>
	<p>Once docked, the selling process is automated, although there
	is no requirement to sell. On the [p]Inventory Screen[/p] a list
	of all your purchased items is given. You can choose if you wish
	to sell your cargo at the current space station or at another
	one.</p>
