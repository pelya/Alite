  <Header>A Coriolis Space Station</Header>

    <Text>
	<p>Every world registered with the Galactic Co-operative has several
	Coriolis space stations in orbit at various altitudes. Coriolis
	stations are &apos;neutral&apos; territory, controlled equally by
	GalCop and the Planetary Government.</p>
	<p>A new dodecahedral design (the so-called &apos;Dodo&apos;
	stations) is replacing the Coriolis design in the more advanced
	systems. Coriolis stations are hexagonal in approximate shape. They
	spin along a single axis running vertically from the planet below.
	One side of the station always faces the planet, and it is on this
	facet that the access tunnel is located.</p>
	<p>Coriolis stations were designed at the GASEC (Galactic
	Astronautic and Space Exploration Centre) Laboratories on the planet
	Vetitice. The first station was in orbit around the world Lave in
	2752.</p>
	<p>Coriolis stations have powerful defensive shields (against pirate
	attack and inept docking) and a large fleet of Viper fighters, and
	several larger types of ships. The inside of the station is
	free-space, and on each inner facet of the station there are
	berthing and refuelling facilities, as well as cities, hospitals,
	farmlands and leisure-scapes.</p>
	<p>Each Coriolis station has a diameter of 1 standard kilometre.
	They can berth 2000 ships, and support a fair-sized colonial life
	development of humanoids.</p>

      	Space stations are cargo transition points for interplanetary
      	trading vessels and shuttle craft. They also provide entertainment
      	and lodging facilities for pilots not wishing to go
      	&apos;planet-side&apos;.
