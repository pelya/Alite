      <p>The Cobra tradeship is fast, and has a very tight turning
      circle (though less tight at full speed); it is an ideal
      combat ship against small packs of enemy vessels. It will
      outrun many attack craft by speed alone, but it will not
      outrun a missile. Spinning, fast-slow, and duck-and-weave
      manoeuvres are very effective against the larger, less
      manoeuvrable ships when they attack. A sudden decrease
      in speed followed by a tight 180Â° turn and an increase
      in velocity will often give you a big advantage over
      pursuing enemy craft.</p>

      You must be prepared to
      outwit your enemies
      tactically. Speed of
      reaction will not in itself
      always be enough.
