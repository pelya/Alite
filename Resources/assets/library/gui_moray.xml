	<p>Developed initially as a submarine flyingboat, Marine Trench Co.
	soon saw the possibilities for extending their operations into space
	and the Moray SFB became the &apos;Star Boat&apos; after its
	ingenious adaptations were completed. Aquatic space-faring races are
	the main users of this multi-purpose vessel, whose hull is able to
	withstand the pressures of depths of up to 5500 fathoms. Standard
	fittings include: highpower seal locks, 2 torpedo tube/single
	missile pods and flood-lock cabins for subaquatic life-forms.</p>
