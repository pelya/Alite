	<p>These unarmed and often unmanned craft are built under license in
	every planetary system. Based on a prototype developed by
	Saud-Kruger AstroDesign, they are used for cargo ferrying between
	planet and space station, but can be modified to hospital ships,
	or orbiting prisons. Favourite targets for small-time criminals,
	because of their instantaneous release of cargo canisters, they are
	often followed by single fighter patrol ships.</p>
