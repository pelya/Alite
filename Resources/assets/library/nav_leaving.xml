    	<p>On coding for Station Depart, by selecting [ip]Launch[/pi]
    	from the command console, the pilot is advised to accept a 10-second
    	MemnSomn to dispense with subjective experience of the passage from
    	docking bay to Coriolis station egress. The screen will then show a
    	break-pattern, which is the passage through the protective field
    	over the Coriolis entrance tunnel.</p>
