        <p>A trader can make his biggest profits here and reach his grave
        the quickest. Worlds like Onisou and Xeesenri have vast wreck-yards
        in far orbit, the dead places of ships that came to trade honestly,
        and fell prey to trickery.</p>
        <p>These are lawless places, and have usually become so because the
        original settlers competed too hard when there was too little
        resource material. Those worlds which survived holocaust did so
        because of uneasy and bloody alliances between clan families.
        Pirates and mercenaries were hired for protection and assassination
        purposes. Anarchic worlds will trade readily in narcotics, slaves,
        firearms and exotica, and the price will be good... if you get a
        price at all. These worlds are almost always supplying invisible
        Masters, usually Ã©lite trader/combateers who have turned to crime
        as the most profitable way of life. Such form loose federations, and
        trade on the black market extensively throughout the galaxies.</p>
        <p>These worlds pay highly for goods they cannot produce themselves,
        because they know that traders avoid them. Their own products need
        specialised, illegal outlets: weaponry, narcotics, eavesdropping
        devices... if it&apos;s covert, then anarchic worlds are producing
        it. Trade in these items and you will get rich quick, or dead quick,
        or at least become a &apos;Fugitive&apos;.</p>
