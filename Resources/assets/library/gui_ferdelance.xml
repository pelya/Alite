	<p>A Zorgon Petterson Group (Zee Pee Gee) designed vessel favoured
	by well-heeled bounty hunters and freewheeling business
	corporations. A sophisticated craft, capable of both limited
	trading, combat, and leisure function. The spacious hull is mainly
	given over to sophisticated weaponry, defences and navigation
	equipment at the expense of cargo capacity. Cabin accomodation is
	large and luxurious with extensive Owndirt Inc. recycling facilities,
	encouraging extended live-in periods (useful whilst pursuing a
	quarry). Fuel scoop is a standard fitting, ensuring complete
	self-sufficiency.</p>
