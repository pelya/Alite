	<p>An ECM System (literally Electronic Counter Measures System) is
	offered for sale at Tech level 2, and may be used any number of
	times given sufficient energy replacement. When activated by the
	button above, ECM destroys all missiles in your vicinity. Some
	enemy ships, especially traders, will have this and may use it
	against your missiles. Your ship&apos;s computer displays an E
	on the console when it detects ECM broadcasts.</p>
