    	<p>Fuel Scoops may be fitted to the hull at a planet of Tech level
    	5 or higher. These enable a ship to obtain free hyperspace fuel by
    	&apos;skimming the sun&apos; -- flying close to it at high
    	velocity.</p>
    	<p>Since fuel scoops utilise powerful electro-magnetic fields to
    	guide the solar wind into their converters, they may also be used
    	to pick up miscellaneous space debris. Almost all pirate vessels are
    	fitted with these so that they can blast their prey apart and sift
    	among the wreckage, rather than attempt to dock with a hostile
    	craft.</p>
    	<p>Once fuel scoops are installed, you can scoop up an object (such
    	as a cargo canister) by keeping it in the lower half of the screen
    	view area while flying right up to it.</p>
    	<p>[b]Fuel scoop specification:[/b] Fuel scoops are considered an
    	essential for Deep Space, and dangerous zone trading. They have a
    	standard design, and a standard fitment. They use powerful
    	electromagnetic fields to guide solar wind or small space debris
    	into their ReQax convertors.</p>
