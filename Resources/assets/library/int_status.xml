      <p>The [ip]Present System[/pi] refers to the planetary system
      which your ship is currently in; while the [ip]Hyperspace
      System[/pi] refers to the system onto which the hyperspace
      is locked.</p>
      <p>There are four possible [ip]Conditions[/pi]: [b]DOCKED[/b] means
      that you are docked in a space station at the Present
      System; [b]GREEN[/b] means that there is no immediate
      danger; [b]YELLOW[/b] indicates enemy ships in the vicinity;
      Condition [b]RED[/b] signals a high-risk on-going death-type
      combat situation.</p>
      <p>[ip]Legal Status[/pi] refers to your Galactic Police record. If this
      is [b]CLEAN[/b] you have nothing to worry about, but as an
      [b]OFFENDER[/b] or, still worse, a [b]FUGITIVE[/b] you are likely to be
      attacked by police ships.</p>
      <p>The [ip]Rating[/pi] is a dispassionate assessment of your
      performance in combat so far.</p>
      <p>Current cash and fuel are also displayed, along with a list
      of ship fittings.</p>
      <p>The status page is always retrievable by pressing the
      [ip]Status[/pi] button in the navigation bar, or by opening the
      in-flight menu and choosing [ip]Status[/pi].</p>

        Commander MONEYBAG
        is rather rich, which is
        quite amazing
        considering he is still
        harmless. He has also
        amassed a large amount
        of equipment for his ship.
