      <p>Pirates, ageing bounty hunters, or planetary outcasts,
      who create living space out of asteroids. They usually
      choose large asteroids, and set up signal beacons to
      warn off miners. GalCop Law protects Rock Hermits, but
      since most of the asteroid is hollowed-out, there is little
      advantage to be gained by &apos;mining&apos; them anyway.</p>
