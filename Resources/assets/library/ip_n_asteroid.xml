    	<p>Asteroid mining involves the fitting of fuel scoops and special
    	mining lasers to your ship. Ships which always carry them are known
    	as &apos;Belters&apos;. They search for asteroids and, on finding
    	one, use the laser to fragment it into pieces sufficiently small to
    	be taken into the cargo bay.</p>
    	<p>[b]Mining lasers specification:[/b] Kruger Model ARM64 Sp. Mining
    	laser is highly recommended as both a trade and combat addition.
    	Uses variable frequency laser rods fired in wide beam, 100
    	channels/beam. Automatic debris-pattern lock ensures no fragments of
    	large size of target asteroid impinging on ship space. Can destroy
    	asteroids of up to 2KtHH durable Mass. Must be fitted with a fuel
    	and matter scoop.</p>
