        <p>It is surprising how many planetary systems will allow the
        purchasing of illegal trade items, notably firearms, narcotics
        (especially Arcturan Megaweed) and slaves. Slaves are supplied in
        cryosuspension in transporter coffins, and often turn out to be
        old and sick specimens of vaguely humanoid life forms. Nonetheless,
        few systems will allow the [i]selling[/i] of these items without
        taking recriminatory action.</p>
