	<p>The Bushmaster is the only known ship built by Lizards.
	Originally intended to rid its home planet of the Lethaloids, the
	ship grew fast in popularity due to its powerful shielding. Not
	operable by human pilots, the Bushmaster is not widely spread and
	a lack of a galactic hyperdrive adds to that.</p>
