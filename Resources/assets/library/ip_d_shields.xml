	<p>Your ship comes equipped with fore and aft shields and energy
	banks. The shields protect your ship from aggressive fire, and will
	be recharged from the energy banks. Constant fire will harm the
	shields. Once a shield is depleted, enemy lasers and missiles
	striking that shield will take energy directly from the energy banks
	and may even destroy items of cargo or ship fittings. When all your
	energy banks are empty your ship will be destroyed. Using lasers or
	an ECM system will also deplete your energy banks.</p>
	<p>The ship&apos;s computer will keep you informed of any damage to
	your ship and will also warn you when energy levels are dangerously
	low.</p>
	<p>An Extra Energy Unit may be fitted at planets of Tech level 8 or
	higher, and doubles the energy bank replenishment rate. This is the
	energy unit with the copper coloured top. No other unit looks like
	it, or lasts like it</p>
	<p>[b]Defensive shield specification:[/b] The shields consist of
	hi-tense flux webs of Zieman-charged sub-particles. They are
	weakest where the laser and missile tubes pass through the
	ship&apos;s hull, and along the central ship band where the two
	shields overlap, and cause a stress zone.</p>
