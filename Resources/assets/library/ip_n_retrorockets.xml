        <p>It has befuddled scientists over the last decades how a seemingly
        simple problem can be so hard. Taking all the inertia of a ship and
        reversing it instantly, even adding thrust in the reversed
        direction, has only been possible for the last 15 years, when
        finally reverse thrusters could be fitted, which would not demolish
        the interior of the ship. Retro rockets can be equipped at any
        Tech level 10 world or above.</p>

        <p>Engaging a retro rocket burst works by pressing the button shown
        above and will propel your Cobra backwards instantly. This is very
        helpful when doing combat against stronger (or faster) opponents,
        or if you want to reach a target quickly. How many bursts you can
        get from one set of retro rockets is always a bit of a gamble. It
        depends on the current load of your ship, but also on the quality of
        the fuel used during rocket production.</p>
    	<p>[b]Retro rockets specification:[/b] Xasar Ion retro rockets are
    	currently the only reliable retro rockets on the market. Coming with
    	450kPH reversers and a constant g-holding quotient, the pilot does
    	not notice the sudden change in direction. Fuel is mined from icy
    	comets around Zamaes, usually yielding clean output.</p>
