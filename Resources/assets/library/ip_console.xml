	<p>[pb]1[/bp] Defensive shields take power from two energy bank
	sources, fore and aft.</p>
	<p>[pb]2[/bp] Missile status depicts the number of missiles on
	board and whether they are &apos;targetted&apos; (yellow) or
	&apos;untargetted&apos; (green) or &apos;locked and ready to
	fire&apos; (red).</p>
	<p>[pb]3[/bp] Energy banks will rapidly drain if defensive shields
	are taking excessive fire. Using lasers or an ECM System will also
	drain their resources. When the fourth bank is tapped, an [b]ENERGY LOW[/b]
	warning will flash onto the screen. Eventually, in normal circumstances,
	the banks will be automatically replenished by surface radiation absorption.</p>
	<p>[pb]4[/bp] Laser temperature will rise during continuous firing of the
	ship&apos;s laser(s). As the central housing overheats, a laser will
	temporarily cut out rather than destroy the system.</p>
	<p>[pb]5[/bp] The 3-dimensional scanner operates in such a way that you
	can pinpoint a ship above and below yours, as well as to the front, behind
	or to the sides. The vertical bars show this clearly.</p>
