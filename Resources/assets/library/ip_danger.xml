      <p>If you cannot make an interspace quick jump (torus drive) towards
      the planet, there is a ship in the vicinity. It could be dangerous.</p>

      <p>If the status screen, during flight, shows <b>YELLOW</b> or <b>RED</b>,
      prepare to engage in combat.</p>

      <p>Laser fire striking the defensive shields makes a light screeching sound.
      Listen for laser fire striking the hull direct. Through damaged screens it
      makes a low, screeching sound. <b>DANGER</b>.</p>

      <p>An incoming missile will be detected, tracked, and a warning message
      will be announced and flashed on the main screen.</p>

      <p>Some star pilots are braver than others and pirate ships may break off
      and run in the face of stiff resistance. Some appear to know no fear --
      in particular Thargoid vessels, whose captains have had their fear
      glands surgically removed.</p>
