	<p>Larger, more popular version of the Cobra Mk I (the Mk II only
	reached prototype stage and was abandoned due to a design fault in
	the hull; it was not convex). This ship is equipped with several
	special features, including Zieman Energy Deflection Shields, fore
	and aft, and mountings for four Ingram Pulse lasers. The Cobra is
	much favored by lone-wolf traders who wish to combine potential
	superior combat qualities with adequate cargo space.</p>
