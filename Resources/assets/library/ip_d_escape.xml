	<p>An escape capsule can be fitted in place of your cabin at any
	world of Tech level 6 or higher. If the button above is hit during
	combat the capsule will be jettisoned from the ship, be
	automatically tracked by the nearest world and will travel safely
	to a Coriolis space station. Your cash will be preserved but all
	your cargo will be lost.</p>
	<p>However, this item comes with a widely recognised insurance cover
	which will guarantee you a new Cobra Class ship, equipped in like
	manner. The contents of the cargo hold is exempt from this
	protection.</p>
	<p>Since the unique IR signature of a ship&apos;s hull is used to
	file police records, abandoning your ship in this way will have the
	effect (unfortunately exploited as much by galactic brigands as
	trader victims) of clearing your police record.</p>
	<p>You may see an escape capsule leaving an enemy ship. This will
	not harm you unless you crash into it.</p>
	<p>[b]Escape capsule specification:[/b] Recommended model is the
	Xeeslan FastJet LSC 7, which can support two human life-forms for
	seven weeks, in moderate suspended An.state.</p>

         Once a defensive shield is depleted, enemy missiles and lasers will
         take energy directly from your ship&apos;s energy banks (1, 2, 3, 4
         on your console). ENERGY LOW appears on-screen when further attacks
         will very soon spell disaster for your ship. This fortunate
         commander has used his escape capsule just in time. His badly
         beaten Cobra can be seen floating in the distance.
