        <p>Piracy is widespread throughout the 8 galaxies, and many pirates
        are not hardened criminals at all, but failed traders who have
        turned to this way of life in desperation. To survive as a pirate,
        looting freighter convoys and small ships, requires a high degree
        of combat experience, since not just Police Vipers will pursue them,
        but other pirate ships and Bounty Hunters, too, will prey upon
        them.</p>
        <p>But the rewards are high. Provided the pirate ship is equipped
        with a fuel scoop, the jettisoned tonne-cannisters of attacked cargo
        ships can be scooped up and traded.</p>
