	<p>Galactic Navy vessel designed and manufactured in government
	workshops, incorporating secret self-destruct services which are
	primed to activate when the astrogation controls are used by
	unfamiliar hands. Integument has chameleon properties enabling the
	ship to assume effective camouflage in any type of environment.
	Intended for reconnaissance and the transport of high-ranking
	military personnel from cobat it is very fast and manoeuvrable.
	Despite its hazardous nature it makes an ideal pirate vessel,
	primarily because of the speed, camouflage and high intensity
	Hassoni-Kruger Burst-lasers. The Asp Mk II has room for powerful
	shield generators, but only one missile pod.</p>
