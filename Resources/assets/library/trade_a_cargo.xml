        <p>Trade ships are often destroyed (by natural catastrophe or enemy
        action) and their cargo left ungathered. Using a fuel scoop such
        &apos;free bounty&apos; can be collected. The contents of the
        canisters will be unknown until they are taken aboard and examined,
        and may be worthless or worth a fortune. If their contents are
        illegal goods, they cannot be traded or sold without legal risk.</p>
        <p>(NB: Pressurised cargo canisters are the Universal means of
        storing cargo for Interplanetary Space Voyaging. Made of HiFlux
        Chromon-alloy, they hold one Gal Tonne of goods, under variable
        pressure and temperature conditions. Tales have been told of such
        barrels being discovered after over five hundred years on barren
        moons, and such &apos;Moon salvage&apos; is a remarkable source of
        historical artefact material.)</p>

	Chromalloy canisters are used to store cargo during space flights.
	They are extremely resilient and may survive the demise of their
	holding vessel. Such canisters can be picked up in space with a fuel
	scoop fitted to the bottom of a ship, but pilots beware picking up
	contraband by mistake since it may harm status and invite attack.
