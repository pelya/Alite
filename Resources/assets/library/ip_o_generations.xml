      <p>Before the devlopment of the WS Thru-Space drive, in
      all its various forms, interstellar travel occurred in large,
      self-sustaining environment ships -- Generation Ships --
      most of which have now been logged and their progress
      monitored. There are more than seventy thousand of these
      immense vessels ploughing their way through the galaxy,
      some of them into their 30th generation. The penalty for
      interference with such a vessel is marooning.</p>
