      <p>There are several ways of identifying a space-going ship
      as &apos;pirate occupied&apos;, and this is essential since pirates
      and renegades will take [i]any[/i] ship for their purpose, from
      a Worm to a massive Python. Pirates exist everywhere in
      the galaxy, but cluster mainly around unstable GalCop
      worlds, especially worlds run on a feudal or anarchic
      system.</p>

      <p>Small ships hovering very distant from a planet are
      pirates. Large ships accompanied by a mixture of small
      fighter types are pirates. Ships that refuse to
      acknowledge identification signals are pirates. Around
      worlds run by autocracies, or clans, pirates will very
      often have been paid to leave trade ships alone. Piracy is
      a huge, and complex, business, and any life-respecting
      trader will learn the tell-tale signs of pirate presence.</p>
