	<p>One of the larger trading vessels manufactured in Inera Orbit
	Space by Whatt and Pritney ShipConstruct. Cabin accommodation is
	cramped and spartan in contract to facilities for cargo and
	&apos;alien environment&apos; transport. Though slow and ponderous,
	the craft has powerful CC-Voltaire shields and Volt-Variscan Pulse
	lasers, earning it the nichname of the &apos;space porcupine&apos;.
	Not commonly attacked by pirate ships, but a popular craft for
	freebooters, usually used as a way-station and storage hulk.</p>
