      <p>In a Co-operative of Worlds as complex as the 2040
      planets of the GalCop, the police can be as menacing as
      they can be helpful. The typical police vessel is a Viper
      GH Class PulseShip, which is very fast, and very
      manoeuvrable. They are on constant standby on every Coriolis
      and Dodec space station, and will attack -- a pirate, or
      a fugitive trader -- within [i]seconds[/i]. They do [i]not[/i]
      make arrests, they destroy. There are different police
      departments serving different purposes -- narcotics,
      space-drunkenness, psychotic shooting, piracy, slave
      trading etc. -- but all have small fleets of these
      very fast Viper patrol craft.</p>

        A clear picture of a
        Mamba Class Fighter, the
        pirate's answer to the
        Viper police ship. Fast and
        manoeuvrable, it is large
        enough to carry two
        homing missiles and ten
        tonnes of cargo.
