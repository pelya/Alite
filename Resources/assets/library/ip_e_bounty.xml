      <p>Unless you have achieved <b>FUGITIVE</b> status, and
      especially if you are highly ranked as a combateer as well
      as being a criminal, bounty hunters will not bother a ship
      as insignificant as a Cobra Mk. III. In fact, many bounty
      hunters favour Cobra trade-ships as they make an excellent
      disguise. But the real killers star-ride in the sleek, and
      highly efficient, Fer-de-Lance Lightspeeder, in which they
      live for months at a time. Bounty hunters can always be
      found outside Orbit Space, especially around worlds
      classified as &apos;dangerous&apos;. They are invariably of combat
      rating <b>DEADLY</b> or <b>ELITE</b>. Bounty hunters
      rarely identify themselves to passing ships, and if
      pestered too closely will usually kill.</p>
