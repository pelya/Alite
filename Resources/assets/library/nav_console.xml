	<p>[pb]1[/bp] Fuel level. Indicates how far your Cobra can travel
	in hyperspace.</p>
	<p>[pb]2[/bp] Cabin temperature will increase and the console register
	this when your ship flies too close to a star.</p>
	<p>[pb]3[/bp] Altimeter. Your altitude above your destination planet
	can be crucial. Flying too near to its surface will be fatal.</p>
	<p>[pb]4[/bp] Radar magnification level if zoomed in.</p>
	<p>[pb]5[/bp] Flight grid scanner. This sophisticated instrument
	displays a three-dimensional view of space in the immediate vicinity
	of your ship, seen from a point behind and above it. The precise
	position of any ship within its range can be pinpointed.</p>
	<p>[pb]6[/bp] Compass. This instrument first picks up a target planet
	while it remains out of range of the main flight-path scanner. When
	the planet's space station nearest to you comes within range of it,
	the compass picks up that instead. When the dot is green, the object
	is behind you; when red and in the centre of the compass circle, it
	should be visible through your front view.</p>
	<p>[pb]7[/bp] Gyro orient bar indicators show right/left roll and
	dive/climb status.</p>
	<p>[pb]8[/bp] S refers to the space station and indicates that you are
	on target for it and within its protective range (the safe zone).
	</p>
	<p>[pb]9[/bp] Forward velocity should be maintained at maximum on
	planetary approach. Keep it low during space station approach, and
	minimal for final docking.</p>
