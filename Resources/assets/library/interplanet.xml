      <p>Not all ships in deep space, even small fighters, are pirates. Most
      ships will respond to hostile action with hostile action. If you attack
      a police ship or trade in contraband goods (see Trading), your legal
      status will be changed to [b]OFFENDER[/b], or even higher. If you destroy
      pirate ships, or Thargoid invaders, (or asteroids) you will receive a
      bounty payment. If you shoot at the Coriolis space station, its own
      defensive ships (Viper class fighters) will attack you.</p>

      Here, a viper can
      clearly be seen leaving
      their Coriolis station,
      probably on a routine
      patrol exercise.
