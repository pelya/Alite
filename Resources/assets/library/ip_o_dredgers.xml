      <p>These immense factory ships are to be found wherever
      there has been a war, or a Thargoid invasion, or a natural
      catastrophe. More than forty miles long, the dredgers are
      a life-form to themselves. The Dredgers are huge cities
      in space, feeding off debris and ruination. Heavily armed,
      and with fleets of reconditioned fighter ships, they are to
      be avoided at all cost.</p>
