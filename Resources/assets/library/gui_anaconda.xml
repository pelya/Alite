	<p>The largest known freighter with a cargo bay designed by Beerbaum
	and ThruSpace Inc., the Anaconda is the only freighter fitted with
	Dizaoner SpaceWares swing-float platforms. These load-balance
	metering devices enable the loadmaster to rearrange the cargo within
	seconds to increase manoeuvrability of the great ship. Equipped only
	with laser weaponry (the 500 Gigazap front-firing pulse), and
	sometimes with missiles, the Anaconda range of craft usually have
	fighter escorts. In trader parlance, the Anaconda is built as strong
	as a rogue asteroid, and steers like one.</p>
