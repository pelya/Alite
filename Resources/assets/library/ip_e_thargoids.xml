      <p>The Thargoids are humankind&apos;s deadly enemy, and
      throughout the 8 galaxies there are at least 50 war zones
      between humanity and Thargoid. This highly technologically
      advanced insectoid race is also at war with 17 other
      space-going life-forms.</p>
      <p>All Thargoid combateers are ruthless in combat, and
      some may be comparable with Ã©lite-status human combat
      pilots.</p>
      <p>Though most of the Thargoid Space Fleet is currently
      engaged by the Galactic Navy in InterGalactic Space, a
      few of the smaller battle ships make occasional
      destructor-raids into human space. These ships are
      extremely fast for their size and invariably have
      anti-missile (ECM) Systems.</p>
      <p>Additionally, most Thargoid battle ships carry several
      small, remote-controlled &apos;Thargons&apos; killer-craft
      each equipped with a single, but highly advanced, pulse-laser.
      The Galactic Navy are developing their own deep-space
      RemCraft, and pay a large bounty for any thargon craft
      that are brought to them.</p>
      <p>(N.B. Bounty on Thargoid invasion craft destroyed is
      very high. Thargoid battle-cruisers are believed to be able to
      &apos;hover&apos; in Witch-Space (hyperspace) and destroy
      through-coming craft).</p>

        The Galactic Banks will
        pay a handsome bounty
        for the destruction of a
        Thargoid invasion ship.
        Your most dangerous
        enemy, a Thargoid may --
        in addition to its own
        fire-power -- activate
        remote controlled killer-craft
        (&apos;Thargons&apos;). Destroy
        the 8-sided mother ship, however,
        and the Thargons will cease to
        pose a threat.
